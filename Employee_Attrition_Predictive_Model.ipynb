        "##What is Employee Attrition ?\n",
        "Employee turnover (attrition) is a major cost to an organization, and predicting turnover is at the forefront of needs of Human Resources (HR) in many organizations.Organizations face huge costs resulting from employee turnover. Some costs are tangible such as training expenses and the time it takes from when an employee starts to when they become a productive member. However, the most important costs are intangible. Consider what’s lost when a productive employee quits: new product ideas, great project management, or customer relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Project concerns a big company that wants to understand why some of their best and most experienced employees are leaving prematurely. The company also wishes to predict which valuable employees will leave next. As well as we also want to help the HR Department in recruiting new employees by predicting his/her attrition rate if he/she is hired as an employee in a particular department."
